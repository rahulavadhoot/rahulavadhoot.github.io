I am a graduate student in Chemical Engineering at the University of Washington (UW). As a part of Data Intensive Research Enabling Clean Technologies (DIRECT) graduate training program, I am enrolled in courses like Software Engineering and Data Science Methods to develop data science and material design skills for discovery and design of advanced materials for clean energy. I am also involved in data-intensive research projects as part of my coursework. This program has introduced me to principles of Machine Learning, Statistics, and Data Visualization. As a part of Beck Research Lab, my research is based on developing machine learning algorithms.

I have worked for a year as a Process Engineer at Reliance Industries Limited, one of India's largest and most profitable companies, at their petrochemicals division where I explored the rich industrial environment to gain thorough proficiency in the fields of process engineering and manufacturing operations. Moreover, I have completed summer internships at Hindalco Industries Limited and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited which helped me develop strong engineering skills like process design and process simulation. My cumulative industrial experience has helped me understand manufacturing processes in detail and develop creative problem solving skills.

I have experience working in data science, computation, process development and design, chemical engineering, and manufacturing. I am pursuing a career path that would allow me to work towards solving the major concerns faced by the world today. I wish to apply my technical and engineering skills towards the development of innovative products. In the long run, I hope to establish myself in a fulfilling career of research and innovation.
